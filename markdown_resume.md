## Projects

### [Excalibrae](https://excalibrae.com)
A vanilla Javascript & HTML application with the single purpose of generating 4th Edition Dungeons & Dragons Magic Item "cards". Developed over a long weekend, with the goal of being able to deploy to Github pages, this small web application allows for the recreation of magic items directly from source books, or for generating your own item stat blocks for your players. 

### [Nightwatch Screenshot Regression Command & Dashboard](https://www.github.com)
A [Nightwatch](https://www.nightwatchjs.org) custom command and report generator that allows for comparison screenshots of elements (or entire pages) within an application's UI as automated tests are executing. As simple as dropping `.compareScreenshot('@element')` into any test allows for quickly catching subtle visual regressions within an application. A custom dashboard then renders reports for each automated run, allowing for quick triage of visual differenced between builds.

### [Star Wars Alexa Dice Skill](https://www.amazon.com/kalebhermes-com-Rebel-Dice/dp/B06XJ6Z9D7/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1511294343&sr=1-1&keywords=rebel+dice) & [Discord Bot](https://github.com/kalebhermes/swdice-discord)
Have you ever wanted to play [Fantasy Flight's Star Wars Tabletop RPG](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/starwarsrpg/) using Alexa to roll those funny dice? Now you can! Simply ask Alexa to roll a pool of dice and she'll do the calculation for you. In addition to rolling with Alexa, I wrote a Discord bot that listens for a special syntax, which will then generate the correct dice pool and report results back to the channel.

### [Markdown Resume](https://github.com/kalebhermes/markdown-resume)
This site that you're on now was generated from a simple markdown file. I wanted an easy way to be able to update my resume without needing to make changes in a text document, and a website. I wrote a small Python script that takes a markdown file and generates an html file, in addition to a PDF, each using CSS to apply the proper styles. They're then automatically uploaded to a small VPS that hosts this site!
