My name is Kaleb. I'm an automation engineer with a strong background in Programatic Marketing and Front End Development. I spend most of my time in Javascript, Node, React/Redux, Selenium, and occasionally Java. I like making applications stable, fast, and responsive. I also like Star Wars.

## Projects
### [Nightwatch Screenshot Regression Command](https://www.github.com)
A [Nightwatch](https://www.nightwatchjs.org) custom command and report generator that allows for compairson screenshots of elements (or entire pages) within an application's UI as automated tests are executing. As simple as dropping `.compareScreenshot('@element')` into any test allows for quickly catching subtle visual regressions within an application.

### [Hearthstone Card Alfred Workflow](https://github.com/kalebhermes/alfred-hearthstone)
If you use a Mac and you don't use [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/), you should. I forked, and eventually re-wrote an Alfred Workflow that allows you to search through all of Hearthstone's cards. You can quickly and easily find any card in the history of Hearthstone and learn everything you need to know about it, and it even displays some shiny golden card art! 

### [Star Wars Alexa Dice Skill](https://www.amazon.com/kalebhermes-com-Rebel-Dice/dp/B06XJ6Z9D7/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1511294343&sr=1-1&keywords=rebel+dice)
Have you ever wanted to play [Fantasy Flight's Star Wars Tabletop RPG](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/starwarsrpg/) using Alexa to roll those funny dice? Now you can! Simply ask Alexa to roll a pool of dice and she'll do the math for you.
